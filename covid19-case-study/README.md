# Welcome to my project on visualising COVID-19 Cases around the World
### This project is one of the challenges by Enterprise DNA. In this project, we are trying to visualise COVID-19 Cases around the world by looking at the confirmed, recovered and deaths for each country. 
### The visualisation for this project is inspired by very esteemed individuals in the PowerBI community!

The Challenge: Businesses and livelihoods are trying to cope as best as they can with COIVD-19, so what is the current status of CV19 across the globe and for any selected country? Is it getting better, worse, do we need to take some action?

The key objectives are:

Connect to open-source data

Import and create a data model

Create a 1 page report of what the current situation is.

Based on the following information, I have created a one-page, high-level analysis of the important statistics to meet the above objectives.

Based on the screenshot above, the following are some of my analyses: 

1) From January 2020 to January 2021, the world received a cumulative of 23 billion cases with 191 affected countries
2) Out of these 191 countries, France emerged as the top country with the highest number of cases
3) While COVID-19 continues to grow exponentially, we see that the proportion of recovered cases far exceed that of death cases
4) Similar to the total number of cases, France emerged as the country with the highest number of Confirmed Cases 
5) However, UK has the highest number of deaths 
6) India has the highest number of recovered cases for the 1 year period 
7) Generally, we see an increasing trend of confirmed, death and recovered cases. 

From the above, let's investigate UK a bit further to tease out any interesting findings:
1) UK had a total of 2bn cases during the 1 year period
2) UK had 136 million death with only 1M recovered.
3) The proportion of confirmed cases to death is significantly higher compared to confirmed to recovered

Now, let's look at France: 

1) While France had the highest number of confirmed cases, France has a higher proportion of recovered cases compared to UK 
2) Still, France's confirmed cases continued to grow at a much higher rate than the number of recovered cases
